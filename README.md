# Contact Cleaner (Python)

This Python script takes a messy contact list from a CSV file and cleans it by:

- Formatting names (e.g., capitalizing properly)
- Removing extra spaces
- Filtering only valid emails
- Keeping contacts with phone numbers
- Removing duplicates based on email
- Saving a clean version as `cleaned_contacts.csv`
  
---

## How It Works

1. The script reads your `contacts.csv` file.
2. It applies formatting and filtering rules.
3. It prints the cleaned contact list.
4. It saves the result to `cleaned_contacts.csv`.
